        <p>Books aid in making me feel grounded thus, i am a major bookworm. I usually need to read a few pages or chapters a day to feel centered.
        So Far for the year I've read close to one hundred and nineth books.
        Besides reading, i like watching anime and my current favourite is One piece which i started and finished in the summer vacation.
        Decided to attend the UWI, Mona due to thier geology programa and my passion for the subject and its principles.
        I am from Trinidad and there isnt a program. I'm also doing computing due to it being a great accessory for most job options.

        I decided on the course web development for a multitude of reasons.The curiosity of creating something as 
        cool as a webpage and the utter joy of seeing your creation starting back at you. Also, everything that this course entails would aid in my further understanding 
        of other computing courses i.e Net-centric computing.
